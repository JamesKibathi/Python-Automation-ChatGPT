# Python-Automation-With-ChatGPT

I used the OpenAI API to generate a Python script to automate any task as per the user prompt.

## Tested the Automation with two use cases:

* Python script that takes any blog article or any web page and it extracts
all the headers from that page or article and then it translates all those headers to Swahili and saves it into its own HTML file so you can open it in the browser and basically see all the headers of that specific blog article translated in Swahili.

* Python script that goes through all the files in our downloads folder it then checks if we have any files that are older than 30 days or were last used
more than 30 days ago and it takes all these files and puts that into a new folder called "to_delete" which we can then review and basically delete if needed.
